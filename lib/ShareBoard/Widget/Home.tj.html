<p>ShareBoard is the proof of concept showcase of Syncler - a distributed backend for <a href="http://joose.it/blog/2011/01/13/introducing-kiokujs/" targer="_blank">KiokuJS.</a></p>

<p>Syncler can characterized as the real-time, distributed, optimistic replication system, based on operations transfer. It keeps several replicas of arbitrary data synchronized, in real-time.</p>

<p>For persistency it can use any KiokuJS backend (though at the moment there's only one (for CouchDB), writing new ones is trivial).</p> 

<p>As the transport, Syncler uses Socket.IO. Due to relative instability of many Socket.IO transports, Syncler work correctly only with websockets, so you may need to open this page in Chrome.</p>
